# EMC-Notes
During last months I acccumulated some (limited) Experience in EMC testing regarding industrial environment.
Since the starting points in these topics are always complex and difficult to find i decided to try and wrap up my findings to try and help anyone that is in my situation.
I am doing this as a personal exercise to try to explain complex topics, advance my technical english and learn to use some documentation tools.
Feel free to contribute to the project in any way you want, even only with questions.

I will try to do at least one document per month but i hope to keep up with one document per week.
all the data for graphics and simulation however takes time and some help may be useful... :wink:
